  - complex-website.json (questions for multi-stack sites)
  - bespoke-project.json (flexible questions for custom projects)
- Migrated brochure-website type to project-types/brochure-website/
  - Moved init.sh, analyze.sh
  - Moved all config files to config/
  - Copied scaffolding from src/

- Added README.md to each stub project type directory

### In Progress

### Next Steps
