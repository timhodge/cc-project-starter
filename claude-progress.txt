### Completed
- Explored 4 related projects for patterns:
  - letters-to-claus: Quality gates, security, accessibility
  - wp-analysis-tools: WPCS, PHPStan WordPress extension

- Created docs/quality-gates-palette.md - comprehensive tools reference
- Created docs/security-patterns.md - CSRF, rate limiting, validation patterns
- Created composer.json.template for brochure, WordPress, Laravel types
- Improved PHPStan configs with strict-rules, WordPress/Laravel extensions
- Created WPCS phpcs.xml for WordPress plugin type
- Created PHPUnit scaffolding (phpunit.xml, bootstrap.php, SampleTest.php)

### Next Steps
